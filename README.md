# Nutcracker

Nutcracker is a web app that makes it easy for cipher enthusiasts (or unlucky Science Olympiad students) to practice some of the most common types of ciphers. 

Check it out here! The interface allows users to solve from a list of ciphers and sign in to save their progress. The frontend is mainly React while the backend is mainly Express + mongoDB.
